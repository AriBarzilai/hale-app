# hale-app
An example prototype Survey app intended to showcase Javascript, React Native, and Tailwind capabilities.

This was part of my application process for an internship at a great company, Hale, where I ended up interning.

The user goes through a pipeline of Landing Page -> Fill out Survey -> Submit -> Confirmation page

A video showcasing the app may be found here https://youtu.be/YIyGaMSYVRg.

The app was tested on a Pixel 3a emulator, although it should ideally be applicable for other phones as well.

This app was made over the course of a few days, and focuses solely on front-end; data is not actually kept/stored for this prototype.
